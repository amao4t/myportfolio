# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is DUONG MANH VU and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, Part 1 was particularly fascinating because it involved creating a practical tool—a spell 
    checker program—that could have real-world applications. I learned how to manage file inputs and 
    outputs in a programming environment, a valuable skill for any software developer. This lab reinforced 
    my understanding of data structures, like vectors, and improved my ability to debug and validate data 
    effectively. Implementing the spell checker helped me understand the importance of accuracy and 
    efficiency in software solutions, especially when dealing with large volumes of text data.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, Part 2 was a standout because it creatively demonstrated the power and flexibility of loops 
    in programming. I thoroughly enjoyed learning how to manipulate loops to generate a precise pattern 
    of characters, mirroring the intricacy of knitting patterns. This exercise honed my skills in loop 
    control and iteration. It sparked my imagination about the parallels between coding and knitting, 
    requiring a methodical yet creative approach to achieve the desired result. Developing this program 
    reinforced the concept of nested loops and gave me a deeper appreciation for their practical application 
    in solving real-world problems.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, Part 2 was fascinating as it introduced me to the fundamentals of game development through the 
    "Hilo" high/low guessing game. Creating this game from the ground up was a fantastic exercise in 
    understanding user interaction within software applications. I developed a solid grasp of conditional 
    logic by designing the game logic and implementing if statements to hint whether a guess was too high 
    or too low. This lab improved my programming skills and allowed me to appreciate how simple code can 
    be used to engage users in an interactive experience. The challenge of making the game both functional 
    and enjoyable taught me the importance of clear user instructions and feedback in game design.
